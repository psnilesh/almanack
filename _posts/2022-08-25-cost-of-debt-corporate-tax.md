A corporate can finance its operations or expansion in two ways :- 1) equity financing or 2) debt financing. Equity financing would dilute ownership of existing shareholders depending on how many new shares were issued. However, if the management decides the market price is unreasonably high, they often choose to sell more equity for acquisitions or pay down existing debt. Debt is the other financing method, where a corporation borrows money from a lender with the promise of annual interest payments and repayment of principal on maturity. Debt allows corporation to expand its operations without diluting ownership. Think about it — if you have a really good business going, why should you voluntarily choose to own less of it ? Its certainly in your best interest to own more of it, especially if think its going to be worth more tomorrow.

## Tax benefits

Even corporations with significant free cash flow can be seen to be owing money to creditors. One might wonder why would a profitable firm borrow money. Well, exact reasons vary but an obvious circumstance is when they are trying to beat a competition to market and can’t develop the product from retained earnings alone. It is also not uncommon for corporations to borrow money even while sitting on a pile of cash when interest rates are quite low. Cost of such borrowings are the interest rate that is paid on the principal. Interest rate could be fixed or vary with risk free rate. Corporate loans might have quite a few intricate details worth knowing while assessing the financial stability of the company, usually disclosed by the management in notes accompanying financial statements. Anyway, creditors / lenders are compensated for letting go of their cash by paying back more than what was borrowed. Assuming fixed interest rate, amount payed back in nominal terms would be,

$$\text{Nominal amount paid} = \text{Interest} \times \text{Principal} \times \text{Number of interest payments} + \text{Principal}$$


For instance, if the loan was granted for $10M at 10% interest due in 5 years, total re-payment in nominal terms would amount to $15M ($10M + $1M x 5). Cost of this loan would thus be $5M (only the interest paid). However, interest payments are tax deductible, meaning corporations need only pay tax on income left after paying interest. So cost of debt becomes net of interest paid and income tax saved. To calculate the “effective” cost of debt, consider the tax owned by a firm with operating earnings EBIT with and without interest payments (INT). We’ll assume the marginal tax rate is ITR.

Thus, we can see that effective cost of debt is always lower than the interest owed since it saves the corporation taxes on margin. If the terms of loan were to pay an interest of 5%, but the corporation is taxed at 40%, effective cost of debt would only be 3% (0.05 x 0.6). Note that this benefit is nullified if the firm has no earnings or is reporting a loss. Since no taxes are owed on losses, cost of debt will remain same as % of interest in the near term, although a loss today can be used to offset profit tomorrow to once again reduce taxes owed.

## In Investing
Investors typically analyze the value of a firm by discounting their estimate of firm’s future cash flows into net present value. We should pay special attention to debt while doing so. Typically, cash flows are projected for 10 to 15 years, which is a very long time in corporate life. Analysts must ensure interest payments are terminated at the right time (which will increase free cash flow from there after) and also account for the repayment of principal when they are due. If the corporate management has given guidance on how they plan to finance future projects, a reasonable amount of debt must be reassumed and its interest payments factored into free cash flow. In summary, DCF analysis should remove interest payments when the debt has been repaid, account for new debt for financing an expansion or acquisition, incorporate the effects to tax while estimating future free cash flows of the firm.

As an aside, corporations much like individuals, have marginal and effective tax rates. Marginal tax rate is used to determine the amount of tax owed on the last dollar of income (ie. 10% on first $100M, 15% on next $200M etc), while effective tax rate is that portion of net income that went towards taxes. While calculating tax adjusted cost of debt above, it was assumed that the tax benefits would not push corporate down to a lower tax bracket. A precise calculation might hence need adjustments with multiple marginal tax rates, but such accuracy may not be of any particular advantage to an investor. 

## Conclusion
Debt is an integral part of corporate expansion. Even companies bathing on cash might choose to finance some of their operations through debt if the interest rates are favorable. It is the analysts responsibility to decode management’s behavior and accommodate effects of any existing or new debt into their estimates of future free cash flow to obtain a more accurate worth of the firm.
